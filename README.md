Contributions are welcome!

1. Check out our [public issues board][0]. If your issue isn't on the board, [open a new one][1].
2. Fork the project ([Need help forking a project?][3]). You'll do all of your work on your forked copy.
3. Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work on that branch ([Need help with branching?][4]).
4. Name the branch something like `fixes-xxx-issue` or `add-xxx-feature` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are adding.
5. Once your code is ready, submit a pull request from your branch to DevJournal's `master` branch. I'll do a quick review and give you feedback.
